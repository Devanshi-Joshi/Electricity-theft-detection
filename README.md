<h2>SGCC Data Electricity theft detection using Deep Learning Models</h2> 

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Electricity theft is a critical issue that affects the sustainability of power distribution systems. Electricity theft can be categorized into two types: technical and non-technical losses. Technical losses are due to the inherent inefficiencies in power transmission and distribution systems, whereas non-technical losses are caused by consumers' intentional tampering with the power distribution infrastructure.

Utilities have traditionally relied on manual inspections, meter readings, and advanced metering infrastructure to combat electricity theft (AMI). These methods, however, have limitations in terms of accuracy, time, and cost, prompting the development of alternative solutions. Deep learning models, which can effectively detect fraudulent behavior in power consumption patterns, are one promising approach.

In this project, I have presented a study that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for detecting electricity theft in the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset. The CNN-LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network that can capture data's spatial and temporal features, making it suitable for analyzing power consumption patterns.

The study follows a rigorous methodology that involves data pre-processing, feature extraction, and model training. Then I evaluated the performance of the CNN-LSTM model on the SGCC dataset, using various performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. My findings demonstrate that deep learning models outperform traditional methods for electricity theft detection and effectively detects technical and non-technical losses.
